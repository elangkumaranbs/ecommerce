  # Fix user signup database error

  1. Problem
    - New user signup fails with "Database error saving new user"
    - This happens because the user_profiles table has RLS policies that prevent automatic profile creation
    - The handle_new_user trigger function may not have proper permissions

  2. Solution
    - Update the handle_new_user function to properly create user profiles
    - Ensure the function runs with proper security context
    - Add a policy that allows the trigger function to insert profiles

  3. Security
    - Maintain RLS security while allowing automatic profile creation
    - Ensure users can only access their own profiles
