# Category Links Removal

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed General Category Route (`client/main.tsx`)
**Removed:**
```tsx
<Route path="/category/:category" element={<CategoryPage />} />
```

This removes the ability to access `/category/men` and `/category/women` routes.

### 2. Updated Header Navigation (`client/components/Header.tsx`)
**Before:**
```tsx
to={item.link || (item.hasDropdown ? `/category/${item.name.toLowerCase()}` : `/products/${item.name.toLowerCase()}`)}
```

**After:**
```tsx
to={item.link || (item.hasDropdown ? `/all-products` : `/products/${item.name.toLowerCase()}`)}
```

Now when users click "Men" or "Women" in the header navigation, they'll be redirected to `/all-products` instead of `/category/men` or `/category/women`.

### 3. Updated CategoryShowcase Links (`client/components/CategoryShowcase.tsx`)
**Before:**
```tsx
let href = `/category/${config.slug}`;
```

**After:**
```tsx
let href = `/all-products`;
```

Now the Men's and Women's collection cards in the CategoryShowcase will redirect to `/all-products`.

## What Still Works

### ✅ Specific Category Routes Still Function:
- `/category/t-shirts`
- `/category/leggings` 
- `/category/shorts`
- `/category/women-shorts`
- All other specific subcategory routes

### ✅ Alternative Navigation Options:
- **Header Dropdown**: Users can still access specific subcategories through the dropdown menus
- **All Products Page**: Users clicking "Men" or "Women" will go to `/all-products` where they can filter
- **Hot Sales**: Still works via `/products/hot-sale`

## User Experience Impact

### Before:
- Click "Men" → `/category/men` (would show all men's products)
- Click "Women" → `/category/women` (would show all women's products)

### After:
- Click "Men" → `/all-products` (shows all products, user can filter)
- Click "Women" → `/all-products` (shows all products, user can filter)

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Navigation**: Reduces the number of category pages to maintain
2. **Consistent UX**: All main category clicks lead to the same filtered page
3. **Better Filtering**: Users get access to advanced filtering on `/all-products`
4. **Maintained Functionality**: Specific subcategories still have dedicated pages

## Testing

You can verify the changes by:
1. Clicking "Men" or "Women" in the header → should go to `/all-products`
2. Clicking category cards in CategoryShowcase → should go to `/all-products`
3. Accessing `/category/men` or `/category/women` directly → should show 404
4. Specific category links like `/category/t-shirts` should still work
